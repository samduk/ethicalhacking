## Demo 



## Workshop Benefits:

1.  **Practical Hands-on Experience:** Participants will gain practical experience using open source tools, which are widely available and cost-effective for penetration testing purposes.
2.  **Enhanced Skills**: Participants will develop the necessary skills to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, and provide comprehensive recommendations for enhancing security.
3.  **Cost Savings**: By utilizing open source tools, organizations can save significant costs associated with commercial penetration testing tools and licenses.
4.  **Customization**: The workshop can be tailored to address specific organizational needs and challenges, ensuring maximum relevance and value for participants.
5.  **Networking Opportunities**: The workshop will provide participants with networking opportunities, allowing them to connect with other like-minded enthusiast in the field and exchange knowledge and experiences.

## Workshop Fees and Logistics:

The workshop itself, including the training materials and instructor fees, will be provided free of charge. However, I kindly request the assistance of the Rokpa Team in arranging the venue, necessary equipment such as a projector, and reliable internet access (as internet connectivity is essential). It is possible that these arrangements may incur fees, which can be borne by the participants.

## Workshop Participants:

- Need to install virtualbox and virtualbox extension in their laptop (https://virtualbox.org)
- Install Kali Linux (https://kali.org)
- Your computer must require 8GB of RAM or above 
- Minimum 50 GB Hard Disk Space available to use 
- **Mac M1 chip doesn't support the virtualization**, therefore, kindly find an alternate machine

Note: The aforementioned setup needs to be completed before the workshop, and the trainer will assist by either sharing video tutorials to help participants prepare their laptops or arranging a Zoom meeting to address any setup-related concerns and ensure everything is in order.


## Expected Outcomes from the Workshop 

1. **Enhanced Understanding of Security Vulnerabilities:** Participants will gain a deeper understanding of security vulnerabilities and potential threats that computer systems, networks, and applications can face. They will learn how to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities to better protect against potential attacks.

2. **Proficiency in Ethical Hacking Techniques:** The workshop will equip participants with practical skills and knowledge in ethical hacking techniques. They will learn how to conduct penetration tests using open source tools, enabling them to assess the security of systems and networks and identify potential weaknesses that need to be addressed.

3. **Improved Security Awareness and Risk Mitigation:** By participating in the workshop, individuals will develop a heightened awareness of the importance of cybersecurity and the potential risks associated with inadequate protection. They will learn how to mitigate those risks and adopt proactive measures to safeguard computer systems, networks, and applications, thereby enhancing overall security posture.
